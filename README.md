# Xtermister

This project is Flutter App that was built to manage pregnent mothers for doctors. There was a requirement to built a app that can perform task under three different requiremnts,
* Keep information about patients
* Calender showing possible due dates of patients marked
* Calculator that can claculate the expected due date when a date is given

To accomadate these three requiremnets navigation bar with three sections was used. Login page and the view of the application once logged in is shown in the below images,

  <table style = "margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
    <tr>
      <td>Login page</td>
       <td>Logged in view</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><image src = https://github.com/vihan125/Xtermister/blob/main/Demonstration/Images/log%20in.jpeg width="300" height="600"></td>
      <td><image src = https://github.com/vihan125/Xtermister/blob/main/Demonstration/Images/list.png width="300" height = "600"></td>
    </tr>
   </table>


Lets look at each of these requirements separately.

## Keeping information about the Patients

In this section required tasks are as follows,
* keep a list of all the pregnent patients that a doctor is consulting
* A categorization of the mother based on their expected  due date
* Sort patients according to each category and due date
* Search patients by name
* Maintain a profile for each patient with the ability of archiving patient when the baby is born, call the patient when necessary, and to keep special notes about patient
* Create a new patient profile

The implementation of the above tasks in the first section is shown in the images below,

* Patients list and sorting them
